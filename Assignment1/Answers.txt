#THIS IS THE PROCESS I FOLLOWED TO SET UP MY DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT.

Q1.
I started with installing windows 11 on my laptop. I did this using a bootable USB drive.
 I downloaded the Windows 11 ISO file from the Microsoft website and used Rufus to create a 
 bootable USB drive. I then booted my laptop from the USB drive and installed windows 11.
 To confirm it, I checked the system properties by right-clicking the start button and selecting 
 system. This is the screenshot to confirm that windows 11 is installed.
 The screenshot is, windows11.jpg
